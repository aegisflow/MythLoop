## 🧬 Dual SKILL System

**Want to create a SKILL?**

MythLoop SKILLs have two parts:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skill.md` | Soul — narrative, ethics, intent |
| `skill.json` | Body — permissions, triggers, execution |

This ensures SKILLs are:
- ✅ Transparent (users understand what they're enabling)
- ✅ Safe (limits are documented and enforced)
- ✅ Ethical (risks and mitigations are clear)
